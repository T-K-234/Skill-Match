# Skill-Match
The Skill Matching Portal is a web-based platform designed to bridge the gap between students and employers. Employers can post job requirements, while students can showcase their skills. The system uses cosine similarity to intelligently match student skill profiles with job descriptions, helping both parties find the best fit efficiently.
